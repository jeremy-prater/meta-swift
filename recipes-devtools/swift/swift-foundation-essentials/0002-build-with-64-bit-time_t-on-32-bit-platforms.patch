Subject: [PATCH 2/2] build with 64-bit time_t on 32-bit platforms

It is good practice to build with 64-bit time_t/timeval on 32-bit platforms to
avoid the Y2038 issue. This is the default when building on Yocto for armv7,
for example. Unfortunately suseconds_t is not an alias to a type of the correct
width (unlike time_t), so for Glibc make it a private alias of time_t to fix
the build.
